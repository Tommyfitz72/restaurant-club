        <p>
          The Restaurant Club exists to bring back a spontaneous dining experience to the people of Boston.
        </p>
        <p>
          We help diners discover last-minute reservation opportunities at top Boston and Cambridge restaurants,
          especially new openings that appear close to service time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: make great nights out easier to find, even when plans happen at the last minute.
